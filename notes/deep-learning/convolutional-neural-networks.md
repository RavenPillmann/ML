# Convolutional Neural Networks
- cNNs can solve lots of problems in a state of the art way

## Applications of CNN
- Audio to text
- NLP (cNNs can be used in NLP, like sentiment analysis)
- Computer Vision (image recognition)
- Training to play a game
- 

## CNN vs. MLPs
- MLPs (Multi layer perceptrons) are often outperformed by CNNs, especially in real world examples where datasets aren't necessarily clean.
- This is in part due to the fact that we need to convert images and other input into vectors for MLPs, but CNNs are built specifically for multi-dimensional input.
- Additionally, CNNs understand that image pixels closer in proximity to each other are more heavily related to each other than pixels far apart
- Similarities include the same loss functions, same optimizers, and the fact that both are built on a series of layers. However CNNs have different kinds of layers than MLPs.
