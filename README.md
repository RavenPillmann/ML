# ML
ML related resources, tutorials, and other materials to explore machine learning

## Running Notebooks
- Using python2.7, `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Probability and Stats Review
- [x] http://www.kevjohnson.org/pdfs/Probability_and_Stats_Refresher.pdf

## Linear Algebra Review
- [x] https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud953/
- [x] http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~zkolter/course/15-884/linalg-review.pdf (good review, but beware of typos (although admittedly they got me to double check my understanding of the material))

## Machine Learning Concepts
- [x] https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning
- [ ] https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/ESLII.pdf

## Machine Learning Practice
- [ ] https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd009t/syllabus/core-curriculum (expensive, but a project based approach that could be beneficial)
