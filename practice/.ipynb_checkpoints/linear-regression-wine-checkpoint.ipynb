    "This data set contains the following numeric variables (descriptions are paraphrased from https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009/data):\n",
    "\n",
    "- *fixed acidity*: Most acids found in wine are fixed\n",
    "- *voltile acidity*: At high levels, voltile acidity leaves a vinegary taste\n",
    "- *citric acid*: Adds freshness or flavor\n",
    "- *residual sugar*: The amount of sugar left over after the wine ferments, measured in grams.\n",
    "- *chlorides*: The amount of salt in the wine.\n",
    "- *free sulfur dioxide*: The free form of SO2, which prevents microbial growth and wine oxidation.\n",
    "- *total sulfur dioxide*: The free and bound forms of S02. At high amounts, this contributes to the nose and taste.\n",
    "- *density*: The density of the wine. This varies based on alcohol and sugar contents.\n",
    "- *pH*: On a scale of 0-14, where 0 is very acidic and 14 is very basic.\n",
    "- *sulphates*: Acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant by contributing to the S02 levels.\n",
    "- *alcohol*: Percent alcohol of the wine.\n",
    "- *quality*: (Based on sensory data), a scale of 0-10\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, I will try to predict the *quality* of the wine based on the other features in the dataset."
